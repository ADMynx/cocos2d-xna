========================================================================================

* Fixed orientation changes and added a test case for the programmatic switching of orientation.
* CCAnimate : Added some defensive code to CCAnimate to prevent NPE exceptions when bad frame refs occur.
* CCNode : Added CCNode.ContentSizeInPixels
* CCNode : Added comments to some methods in CCNode
* CCPoint : Added the CCPoint(CCPoint) ctor.
* CCPoint : Added arithmetic operators to CCPoint.
* CCBMFontConfiguration : Removed an assert in the CCBMFontConfiguration class during FNT 
  file parsing. Replaced it with an exception.
* CCBMFontConfiguration: Added exception handling around the CCBMFontConfiguration parsing 
  and recording of kerning elements to handle when duplicate kerning configurations are parsed.
* CCLayer : Moved the initial setting of the content size to the ctor instead of "init".
* CCScene : Added the game state management code
* CCSpriteFrameCache : Added an attribute to control whether or not frame overwrite is allowed.
* CCSpriteFrameCache : Replaced the use of "add(spriteFrame)" with the indexer on the sprite frame
  dictionary.
* CCSpriteFrameCache : Added ability to overwrite sprite frames in the sprite frame cache.
* CCTexture2D : Added a non-size-specific file name fallback to the loading of the default
  system font.
* CCTMXLayer : Fixed a typo in the "CCTMXOrientatio" enum to be "CCTMXOrientation".
* CCTMXMapInfo : Fixed a typo in the "CCTMXOrientatio" enum to be "CCTMXOrientation".
* CCTMXXMLParser : Fixed a typo in the "CCTMXOrientatio" enum to be "CCTMXOrientation".
* CCDirector : Added the state management code
* CCDirector : Fixed an indexing error in ReplaceScene when the stack is empty.
* CCDirector : Fixed the pause/resume/purge/resurrect lifecycle when running on Android
* CCNode : Added BoundingBoxInPixels
* CCPoint : Added a copy ctor
* CCPoint : Added a Length method
* CCRect : Added an intersection method
* CCMenu : Changed the ctor to set its content size as the window size.
* CCMenu : Added checks for menu item visibility during layout functions.
* CCMenu : Added the ability to set the content size of the menu and preserve it instead of
  overwriting it with the window size during layout.
* CCApplication : Added calls to the ApplicationWillEnterForeground and ApplicationDidEnterBackground
  when activated and deactivated are called. These were not being called during the application lifecycle.
* CCApplication : Began adding code to handle gestures (they consume touch begin states, beware).
* CCTouch : Added some comments to remind us that we need to support gestures.
* CCSprite : Added sprite collision detection. This appears to be very slow on some android devices.
* CCDirector : Added CanPopScene to return true if there is more than one scene on the stack.
* CCScheduler : Added try/finally to ensure that the update lock and current target get reset.
