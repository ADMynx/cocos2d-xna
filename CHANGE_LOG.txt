========================================================================================

* Fixed orientation changes and added a test case for the programmatic switching of orientation.
* CCAnimate : Added some defensive code to CCAnimate to prevent NPE exceptions when bad frame refs occur.
* CCNode : Added CCNode.ContentSizeInPixels
* CCNode : Added comments to some methods in CCNode
* CCPoint : Added the CCPoint(CCPoint) ctor.
* CCPoint : Added arithmetic operators to CCPoint.
* CCBMFontConfiguration : Removed an assert in the CCBMFontConfiguration class during FNT 
  file parsing. Replaced it with an exception.
* CCBMFontConfiguration: Added exception handling around the CCBMFontConfiguration parsing 
  and recording of kerning elements to handle when duplicate kerning configurations are parsed.
* CCLayer : Moved the initial setting of the content size to the ctor instead of "init".
* CCScene : Added the game state management code
* CCSpriteFrameCache : Added an attribute to control whether or not frame overwrite is allowed.
* CCSpriteFrameCache : Replaced the use of "add(spriteFrame)" with the indexer on the sprite frame
  dictionary.
* CCSpriteFrameCache : Added ability to overwrite sprite frames in the sprite frame cache.
* CCTexture2D : Added a non-size-specific file name fallback to the loading of the default
  system font.
* CCTMXLayer : Fixed a typo in the "CCTMXOrientatio" enum to be "CCTMXOrientation".
* CCTMXMapInfo : Fixed a typo in the "CCTMXOrientatio" enum to be "CCTMXOrientation".
* CCTMXXMLParser : Fixed a typo in the "CCTMXOrientatio" enum to be "CCTMXOrientation".
* CCDirector : Added the state management code
* CCDirector : Fixed an indexing error in ReplaceScene when the stack is empty.
* CCDirector : Fixed the pause/resume/purge/resurrect lifecycle when running on Android
* CCNode : Added BoundingBoxInPixels
* CCPoint : Added a copy ctor
* CCPoint : Added a Length method
* CCRect : Added an intersection method
* CCMenu : Changed the ctor to set its content size as the window size.
* CCMenu : Added checks for menu item visibility during layout functions.
* CCMenu : Added the ability to set the content size of the menu and preserve it instead of
  overwriting it with the window size during layout.
* CCApplication : Added calls to the ApplicationWillEnterForeground and ApplicationDidEnterBackground
  when activated and deactivated are called. These were not being called during the application lifecycle.
* CCApplication : Began adding code to handle gestures (they consume touch begin states, beware).
* CCTouch : Added some comments to remind us that we need to support gestures.
* CCSprite : Added sprite collision detection. This appears to be very slow on some android devices.
* CCDirector : Added CanPopScene to return true if there is more than one scene on the stack.
* CCScheduler : Added try/finally to ensure that the update lock and current target get reset.

* CCNode : Added android specific code to refresh sprite font labels during re-activation.
* CCGeometry : Adding convenience methods to CCPoint
* CCObject : Added data serializers for data state deserialization.
* CCLabelTTF : Added dispose calls on the CCTexture2D for rendered labels.
* CCLayer : Added multi and single touch distinctions to touch handling.
* CCApplication : Added android specific activation support code to fix disappearing textures and labels.
* CCApplication : Added automatic media state recovery upon game deactivation.
* DrawManager : Added code to check the status of the graphics device to prevent creating render targets
  when the framebuffer is not initialized.
* CCSprite : Added a bit based collision mask for sprite collisions.
* CCTexture2D : Added smarter code to handle resurrecting textures after the game activates from a
  sleep state.
* CCTextureCache : Added a dispose method and code to reconstrucct the texture cache upon activation.
* CCDirector : Improved the serialization and deserialization code.

* gamepad_dispatcher : Added two new classes to handle the gamepad state better.
* CCTexture2D Test : Fixed a concurrent access exception in the CCTextureCache.
* CCTexture2D Test : Changed the 512, 1024, and 2048 test patterns.
* CCAccelerator : Added xbox/ouya ifdef tags to exclude them from building accelerometer support.
* Added XBox 360 project files for the framework and tests.
* tests: TileMapTest : removed all but the uncompressed test for xbox deployment.
* Added an xbox 360 version of the CSharpZipLib library that removes its encryption capabilities.
* tests: ParallaxTest : Added gamepad support to test pan and rotation of the map.
* tests: TileMapTest : Added gamepad support to test pan and rotation of the map.
* tests: Added a new initial test menu that responds to the d-pad and gamepad buttons.
* external lib: Added iOS and MacOS build libraries based upon MonoGame 3.0.0.0
* tests: Decompressed most of the tile map TMX test files and ran them on xbox 360.
* tests: Added an iOS build of the test content.
* tests: Updated the PSM project file to include all of the content files.
* tests: Removed the display of the assembly version for PSM.
* tests: Removed the PMA optimization directive for iOS. 
* tests: Fixed a file name error in the particles test.
* tests: Updated the XNB files for android and copied the plist and fnt xnb files over to iOS.
* CCTransitionFlipAngular : Obsoleted the 'create' method and added a parameter ctor.
* CCTransitionFlipX: Obsoleted the 'create' method and added a parameter ctor.
* CCTransitionFlipY : Obsoleted the 'create' method and added a parameter ctor.
* FlipXLeftOver, FlipYDownOver, FlipAngularRightOver, FlipYUpOver, FlipXRightOver : Added parameter ctor
* DrawManager: Changed the RenderTarget2D creation to set depth to Depth16 for iOS.
* CCTransitionScene : Added boolean to indicate whether the scene is a transition or not.
* CCDirector : Fixed erroneous hiding of the current scene when switching to a transition scene.
* XBox : Added the GitHubIssue5 test case to the project.
* Tests : Removed the assembly name display on windows phone.
* FadeWhiteTransition : Fixed broken blending state
